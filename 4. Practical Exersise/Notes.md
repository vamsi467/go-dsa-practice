### Exercise: Simple Calculator

To reinforce these concepts, let's write a simple calculator program. This program will:
   - Take two numbers as input.
   - Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Here's a skeleton of the program:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
)

func main() {
    var num1, num2 float64
    fmt.Println("Enter two numbers: ")
    fmt.Scanln(&num1, &num2)

    // Perform arithmetic operations and display the results
    // Add, subtract, multiply, and divide num1 and num2
}
```

Your task is to implement the arithmetic operations inside the `main` function. Try to use functions for each operation. This exercise will help you get comfortable with basic Go syntax and functions.

How are you finding Go so far? Do you need any clarifications on these concepts?
